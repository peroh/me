Is it just a bunch of nerds sitting in a dark room trying to hack into MI6?
Absolutely not. Well who knows, I’m not ruling that out as a possibility.

A hackathon is where people from all walks of life get together in a common
place over a certain period of time to work on a project. They often get a theme
or topic to work with, and will be required to present or pitch their project at
the end of the hackathon. The idea is to build, or “hack”,  everything from
scratch over a short period of time.

The beauty of a hackathon is you can go in knowing absolutely nobody, and within
2 hours you’re working with a likeminded, yet diverse, team to solve a problem
you  may never have even realised existed. In a world where weekends are often
filled with the regular cycle of get wasted, then hungover, then depressed about
going back to work, I’m pretty excited to be involved in a hackathon this
weekend.

CodeBrew is a hackathon run by the University of Melbourne tech group, CISSA.
It’s the second year they have put on it on, and already the participants have
doubled, and sponsors are flooding in with over $5000 worth of prices up for
grabs this year. The theme is Food and Innovation, so all participants are
required to work on an innovative solution that somehow relates to a problem
with food. Teams are between 4 and 6 people, and pitches are 5 minutes. Other
than that, there’s no more rules!

On top of all the participants, there are heaps of judges, mentor and staff
hanging around all weekend to help out and learn something themselves. The
mentors are experienced industry professionals and are there to run workshops
and provide support. The workshops break up the hacking throughout the weekend
and are based on relevant topics such as design, development, pitching, lean
startup, business models and UI/UX. The judges are from a diverse industry
background and are there to provide their input and implement the judging
criteria. CodeBrew also has resident hackathon godess Michelle Mannering helping
out and also competing!

Everyone is really excited to see what comes of this weekend. To keep updated
