# Software Modelling and Design

## Modelling and Design

Aim is to learn about **Software Modelling** and **Software Design**

### Software Design

*Purposefully* choosing the *structure* and *behaviour* of the software system.
Behaviour is about how the system *responds to inputs and events*, and choosing
how parts of the system *collaborate to achieve goals*.

### Software Modelling

Creation of tangible, but abstract, representations of a system so that design
ideas can be communicated and critiqued, and alternatives explored.

## Analysis and Design

### Analysis

**Analysis** - investigation of the problem and requirements

***Object-Oriented Analysis***  - finding and describing objects and concepts in
the problem domain

### Design

**Design** - conceptual solution to a problem that meets the requirements

***Object-Oriented Design*** - defining software objects and their collaboration

### Implementation

**Implementation** - a concrete solution to a problem that meets the
requirements

***Object-Oriented Implementation*** - implementation in object-oriented
languages and technologies

Object-orientation emphasises the *representation* of objects.

![Representation of objects](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/01_representation.png){:class="image fit-small"}

We want to *understand the domain* &rarr; *represent it* &rarr; *define
solution* &rarr; *implement it*

(all in terms of objects)

Should be able to:

* apply **principles** and **patterns** to create better designs
    * assign **responsibilities** to SW objects with emphasis on the **9 GRASP**
      principles
* iteratively follow a set of common analysis and design activities (based on
  Agile/Unified Process)
* create frequently used **models in UML**

### Domain Model

Used to visualise real-world concepts.
Includes domain objects, attributes, responsibilities and multiplicities.

![Domain Model](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/02_domain_model.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### Design Class Diagram

Used to visualise software elements. Includes *classes*, *attributes*, *methods*
and multiplicities.

![Design Class Diagram](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/03_design_diagram.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Structure:

1. System
2. Build
3. Subsystem
4. Package
5. Cluster

If packages are highly dependent on each other, they are highly *coupled*. High
coupling is usually bad and hard to understand.

Developers tend to add complexity unnecessarily if unconstrained. Important to
ensure developers think through implications of a structure/design change to
maintain good design (particularly important in large projects).

This subject focusses on the object-oriented design method, with object-oriented
modelling and modelling heuristics.

*Sidenote*: ***Heuristic*** - any approach to problem solving that employs a
practical method not guaranteed to be optimal but sufficient for immediate
goals. Used when classic methods are too slow, or for finding an approximate
solution when classic methods fail to find any exact solution.

**UML** - Unified Modelling Language

# Domain Models

Should be able to:

* Identify conceptual classes related to the current iteration
* Create an initial domain model
* Model appropriate attributes and associations

Domain models look at the role that *use cases* play in relation to modelling.
The purpose is understanding the problem space (not talking about software yet).
The domain objects will be familiar to experts in the problem space.

![Artefacts](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/04_artefacts.png){:class="image fit-small"}

This diagram shows the relationship between *artefacts*.

![Associations and Attributes](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/05_assoc_attr.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Associations** - model the relationships between the objects

**Attributes**  - give information about the domain objects beyond the
relationships

A domain model should not include:

* software artefacts/classes (such as a database)
* methods

### Conceptual Class

An idea, thing, or object in the real world

A Conceptual class C is a combination of:

* **Symbol** - words or images representing C
* **Intension** - the definition of C
* **Extension** - a set of instances represented by C

![Conceptual Class](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/06_conceptual_class.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### Representation Gap

Ideal to keep the “representation gap” between domain and design model as small
as possible. This helps stakeholders to understand the software. The domain
model should inspire objects and names in the design model.

Steps to creating a domain model:

1. Find the conceptual classes
    1. Reuse or modify existing models
    2. Use a category list
    3. Identify noun phrases
2. **Draw them as classes in a UML class diagram**
    Make a list of candidate conceptual classes in domain based on commonly
    occurring categories e.g:
    * *Business transactions* - Sale, Payment
    * *Physical objects* - Item, Register, Board, Piece
    * *Containers of things* - Store, Bin, Aeroplane
    * *Recording transactions* - Register, Ledger
3. **Add associations and attributes**

Modelling is highly iterative, need to keep adding, removing and adjusting.

### Attributes vs Classes

If something is not considered a number or text in the real world, it's probably
a conceptual class, not an attribute.

### Description Classes

A description class contains information that describes something else. Should
be used when:

* groups of items share the same description
* items need to be described even when there are currently no examples
* it reduces redundant or duplicated information
* deleting instances results in losing required info

We should clearly distinguish between items and their descriptions to avoid
duplication.

![Item Descriptions](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/07_item_descriptions.png){:class="image fit-small"}

![Flight Description Example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/08_flight_example.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### Associations

An association represents some meaningful and significant relationship between
classes. Guidelines:

* significant in domain (don't have to model all associations)
* knowledge of the relationship needs to be preserved
* derived from common associations list

**Association category list**:

* A is a **member of** B - *Cashier-Store, Player-MonopolyGame, Pilot-Airline*
* A is a **role related to** a transaction B - *Customer-Payment,
  Passenger-Ticket*
* A is **physically or logically contained in/on** B - *Register-Store,
  Item-Shelf, Square-Board*
* A is **known/logged/recorded/reported/captured** in B - *Sale-Register,
  Piece-Square*

![Association](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/09_assoc.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Association name** - User verbs

**Multiplicity** - `0..1` &rarr; “optionally-one”. Multiplicities will be
dependent on the context and what rules we want to enforce.

![Multiplicities](

### Use Cases

**Use Cases** - Textual representations of how particular users or actors
interact with the system to achieve a goal

**Use Case Diagrams** - Give an overview of the use cases and the relationships
between them

**SuD** - system under discussion (what we're aiming to develop)

**Actor**  - something with behaviour, such as a person, computer system or
organisation (e.g. a cashier). Interacts with the SuD (can be people or other
  systems). Can trigger behaviour in the system and react to output.

**Scenario (use case instance)** - a specific sequence of actions and
interactions between actors and the SuD

**Use Case**  - a collection of related success and failure scenarios that
describe an actor using the SuD to support a goal. Non-conditional (a specific
sequence). Use Cases are *text*, not diagrams, and are *not object-oriented*
constructs.

A use case can be *brief*, *casual* or *fully dressed*.

With use cases don't say anything about how the user interacts with the system,
just what *information is going in or out*.

Define the **main success scenario** and any **alternate scenarios**.

![Fully dressed use cases](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/16_fully_dressed.png){:class="image fit-small"}

![Use Case Diagrams](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/17_use_case_diagram.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Types of **Actors**:

1. *Primary* - uses services of the SuD
2. *Supporting* - provides a service to the SuD (often a computer system, but
   not necessarily)
3. *Offstage* - has an interest in behaviour of the use case, but is not primary
   or supporting

![Use Case](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/18_use_case.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Tests for *“Useful”* Use Cases:

1. *Boss Test* - would your boss be happy if you told them the use case you've
   been working on all day?
2. *Elementary Business Process Test* - should be a task performed by one person
   in one place at one time, in response to a business event, which adds
   measurable business value and leaves the data in a consistent state
3. *Size Test* - very seldom a single action/step; often 3-10 pages of text for
   a fully dressed use case

**Object-Oriented Layers**

An example of layers can be:

* *User Interface*
* *Application Logic* - our **primary focus** &rarr; explore how to
  design objects (other layers can be technology/platform dependent)
* *Other layers/components*

# System Sequence Diagrams

A form of **dynamic modelling**. They capture the **dynamic context** of the
system.

Treats the system as a black box.

Derived from use cases.

Objectives:

* identify system events
* create system sequence diagrams for use case scenarios

System Sequence Diagrams (SSDs) try to work out what **events the system needs
to handle** by going through the use case diagrams and extracting the sequence
of events.

![Basic SSD](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/19_ssd.png){:class="image fit-small"}

A SSD analyses the “external” behaviour of the system.

Sometimes show what's going inside the system “black box” if it's necessary to
understand what is going on.

**Multiple Actors**

![Multiple Actor SSD](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/20_ssd_multiple.png){:class="image fit-small"}

`Mobile user` is the **primary user**. Can have **secondary actors** like
`ProductInventory` and `MappingService`.

Both indicate a *return*, just different notation (explicit vs implicit):

1. `closestToMe(storeLocations): storeLocation`
2. `:store`

Choose *abstract naming* e.g. `enterItem(...)` is better than `scan(...)`

# Interaction Diagrams

### Sequence Diagrams (SD)

*Different to **SSD***

![Sequence Diagram](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/21_sd.png){:class="image fit-small"}

1. External source generates the method call `doOne`
2. A now has control of execution of the system
3. A asks B to `doTwo` and passes control to B
4. Control returned to A
5. A asks B to `doThree` and passes control to B
6. Control returned to A

### Communication Diagram

Not constrained by layout like a sequence diagram &rarr; more like a class
diagram

![Communication Diagram](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/22_cd.png){:class="image fit-small"}

```java
public class A {
    private B myB = new B();

    public void doOne() {
        myB.doTwo();
        myB.doThree();
    }
}
```

* Instance of Class A
* A has access to B through a private variable called myB
* When `doOne() `is invoked in A
* Ask B to `doTwo()`
* Ask B to `doThree()`

## Polymorphism

Subclasses of a class can define their own unique behaviours and yet share some
of the functionality of the parent class.

In Java, the JVM calls the appropriate method for the object that is referred to
in each variable. It does not call the method that is defined by the variables
type. This behaviour is referred to as *virtual method invocation.*

`Payment` &rarr; abstract superclass

`CreditPayment` and `DebitPayment` &rarr; concrete subclasses

Both subclasses have to implement the `authorize()` abstract method.

![Polymorphism in `Payment`. Both subclasses have to implement the
`a{{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/e()` abstract method]({:class="image fit-small"}
  images/50_poly_payment.png)

![A “T diagram” showing **polymorphic variants**](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/51_poly_t.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### Asynchronous Calls & Active Objects

Synchronous &rarr; wait for executed statement to finish before executing next
statement

Asynchronous &rarr; can move onto another task before the previous one has
finished

**SD**

*Strengths*:

* Time Ordering
* Shows detail between objects

*Weaknesses*:

* Linear Layout can obscure relationships
* Consumes horizontal space

**CD**

*Strengths*:

* More layout options
* Shows relationships b/w objects
* Combines scenarios to provide complete picture

*Weaknesses*:

* More difficult to see message sequencing
* Fewer notation options to express patterns

# GRASP Responsibilities

**GRASP** - General Responsibility Assignment Software Patterns/Principles

**Responsibility**: A *contract* or *obligation* of a *classifier*

A **classifier** is a class/interface or other component of the software system.

We want to make components *responsible* for some part of the system.

**Doing** responsibilities:

* *Direct* - create object, perform calculation
* *Initiate action* in other objects
* *Control and coordinates activities* in other objects

**Knowing** responsibilities (informational knowledge):

* Private, encapsulated data (made available through methods)
* Related objects
* Derivable or calculable items

**Responsibilities** and **Methods** are related but not the same:

* Responsibility &rarr; abstract concept
* Methods &rarr; concrete ways of meeting responsibilities

**Responsibility driven design** sees an OO design as a *community of
collaborating, responsible objects.*

Involves **assigning responsibilities** to classes based on **proven
principles.**

9 GRASP principles are:

1. Creator
2. Information Expert
3. Low Coupling
4. Controller
5. High Cohesion
6. Polymorphism
7. Indirection
8. Pure Fabrication
9. Protected Variations

### 1. Creator

Deals with problem of which class is responsible for creating a new instance of
a class. The action of creating another class is an assignment of
responsibility.

We want to ensure *low coupling*, *increased clarity*, *encapsulation* and
*reusability*.

**B** should be responsible for creating **A** if:

* **B** contains or compositely aggregates **A** (most important)

* **B** records **A**

* **B** has the initialising data for **A** (B is an expert)

![Dynamic example of Creator pattern](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/52_creator_dynamic.png){:class="image fit-small"}

When board is created, the board is assigned the responsibility of creating
squares.

![Static example of Creator pattern](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/53_creator_static.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Contraindications**

May decide against the creator pattern in the case of:

* Creation of significant complexity e.g.
    * When recycling instances for performance (taking objects from a pool
      before creating new ones)
    * Only retrieving specific instances based on property

In these cases we can delegate to a helper class in the form of  a
*Concrete Factory* or *Abstract Factory*.

### 2. Information expert

A general principle to assign responsibilities to objects to achieve outcomes
that are easier to understand, maintain, extend and reuse.

Assign responsibility to the class that has the information necessary to fulfil
the responsibility.

![Example of Information Expert](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/54_information.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Contraindications**

Don't use expert if the suggested solution results in poor coupling or cohesion.

### 3. Low Coupling

Coupling is a measure of how strongly one element is **connected to, has
knowledge of, or relies on** others.

It relates to the connections between components in a software system. More
connections &rarr; harder to maintain.

Low coupling suggests assigning responsibility so that the design supports
**low dependency, low change impact and increased reuse**. The lower the
dependency the less changes propagate through the system.

**Contraindications**

* High coupling to stable elements like Standard Java Libraries is not an issue
* Coupling is actually essential, so we are just choosing to keep it low where
  we can without compromising other design aspects.

### 4. Controller

Relates to which object receives the first message from an **external system**
and coordinates/controls a **system operation** (major input event, appears on
SSD).

Assign responsibility to a class representing one of:

* the **overall system**, a **"root" object**, a **device** the system is
  running in, or a **major subsystem**
    * a *facade controller* &rarr; representation of system as a whole with
    routing point where all messages go through
* a use case scenario or session controller that deals with the event in
  complex systems

The controller lives just under the UI layer in the domain layer. The UI layer
needs to know where to route the message to.

![Example of Facade Controller](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/55_controller.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Contraindications**

Can sometimes get a **bloated controller** with too many responsibilities and
low cohesion. The controller becomes too complicated with too much logic and
duplicated information. Solutions:

* May need to add more controllers based on use case.
* Delegate to responsibility

### 5. High cohesion

Keeping objects focussed, understandable and manageable. A measure of how
strongly (functionally) related and focussed the responsibilities of an element
are.

![Example of High Cohesion](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/56_cohesion.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Contraindications**

* Lower cohesion sometimes required to meet non-functional requirements such as
  performance.
* Coupling and cohesion are fundamental design properties that are
  interdependent and must be considered together.

### 6. Polymorphism

If we purely use if-else's, we get a proliferation of them. Need a better way of
handling alternatives based on type.

Allows us to handle alternatives based on type by giving a single interface to
entities of different types. When related alternatives differ by type (class):

* Use operations with the same interface to assign responsibilities for the
  behaviour to the types for which the behaviour varies

Polymorphism helps us to create *pluggable software components*.

Polymorphic &rarr; “giving a single interface to entities of different types”

Adapters &rarr; objects responsible for handling varying interfaces.

![Example of Polymorphism - Adapter](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/57_adapter.png){:class="image fit-small"}

If the superclass doesn't have any default behaviour, declare it `{abstract}`.

![Example of Polymorphism - Abstract](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/58_poly_abstract.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### 7. Pure Fabrication

Which object should have responsibility when solutions offered (say, by Expert)
violate High Cohesion and Low Coupling?

Can **fabricate an object** not in the domain to give a better design. Required
when a low representation gap/ solution offered by expert causes high
coupling/low cohesion.

Only to be used when other techniques don't work.

Example: Creating a `PersistentStore` for saving DB related transactions like a
`Sale`.

**Contraindications**

* Sometimes driven by behavioural decomposition into functions, resulting in
  functions being group into objects. Don't just create an object when looking
  for a place to put a quick set of functions.

### 8. Indirection

Where to assign responsibility to avoid direct coupling between two or more
software elements?

![Example of Poor Coupling](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/59_coupling_poor.png){:class="image fit-small"}

De-coupling components so that low coupling is supported and reuse potential
remains high by assigning the responsibility to an **intermediate object**. The
intermediary creates an *indirection* between the other components.

![Example of Indirection](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/60_indirection.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Coupling isn't about the number of links but the nature of those links.

![Adaptor pattern is an example of indirection](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/61_adaptor_indirection.png){:class="image fit-small"}

### 9. Protected Variations

A way of designing objects/systems so that variations/instability in these
elements do not have an undesirable impact on other elements.

Identify known or predicted variation/instability and assign responsibilities to
create a stable interface around them. An interface refers to **a means of
access**, it's not just a programming language interface.

Points of change include:

* **variation points**: variations in existing system - *e.g. multiple tax
  calculators*
* **evolution points**: speculative variations that may arise in the future

**Open-Closed Principle (OCP)** - *strongly related to protected variation*

Modules should be both open (for extension; adaptable) and closed (to
modification that affects clients) e.g. define a class and only use access
methods &rarr; can change field definitions without impacting clients

**Contraindications**

Cost of speculative “future-proofing” at evolution points can outweigh the
benefits. Can be cheaper/easier to rework a simple “brittle” design.

![Relationship between GRASP Principles](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/62_grasp_relationship.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**GRASP Examples**

![3. High cohesion, low coupling (*better option*)](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/67_grasp_example5.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Here `makePayment()` is delegated to `Sale`, and `Sale` creates `Payment.`

# Visibility

*Object Oriented Analysis and Design* (OOAD) applies encapsulation (through
objects and classes).

* High cohesion &rarr; encourages grouping highly related responsibilities
* Low coupling &rarr; encourages minimising dependency on other elements
* Design &rarr; requires assigning responsibilities and objects cooperating to
  achieve required outcomes
* Objects &rarr; require visibility of each other to cooperate

How does `Register` gain visibility of `ProductCatalog`?

![Visibility - `:Register` and `:ProductCatalog` example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/68_vis_register.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Accessing objects can be done in a few ways:

* Create new object
* Access existing object
    * Global object
    * Made available at some point
        * Passed in as a constructor
        * By calling one of our own methods
        * Is an attribute of class

The different ways in which we access objects has an impact on the *coupling* of
the design.

## What is visibility?

The ability of an object to **see** or **refer** to another object.

For A to **send a message** to B, B must be visible to A.

Being in **scope** or visible:

1. B is **an attribute** of A
2. B is **a parameter of a method** of A
3. B is a **local object** in a method of A
4. B has in some way **global visibility**

### 1. Attribute Visibility

Attribute visibility is considered a tight form of coupling.

![Attribute Visibility](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/69_attribute_vis.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Here we can make `ProductCatalog` an attribute of `Register`:

```java
class Register {
    ...
    private ProductCatalog catalog;
    ...
    public void enterItem(int itemID, int qty) {
        ...
        desc = catalog.getProductDesc(itemID)
        ...
    }
}
```

### 2. Parameter Visibility

Looser form of coupling than attribute visibility.

![Parameter visibility](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/70_param_vis.png){:class="image fit-small"}

`Register` already needs to know about `ProductCatalog`, so it gets it and
passes to `Sale` as a parameter of `makeLineItem(...)`

A worse option with higher coupling would be passing the item `id` into `makeLineItem(...)` and making `ProductCatalog` visible to `Sale` in some way.

Parameter to attribute visibility &rarr;  pass a parameter in to a constructor
and save it as an attribute. This gives higher coupling.

e.g.

```java
SalesLineItem(ProductDescription desc, int qty) {
    ...
    ProductDescription description = desc;
    ...
}
```

### 3. Local Visibility

Where we provide access through scope of declaration (temporary visibility).

```java
enterItem(int id, int qty) {
    ...
    ProductDescription desc = catalog.getProductDesc(id);
    ...
}
```

`desc` has limited context &rarr; not available outside of `enterItem`

This is *weak, localised* coupling.

*Note:* even if `catalog` wasn't stored as an attribute, if we were to somehow
access the catalog e.g. `other.getCatalog().getProductDesc(id)` that is still a
dependency (still coupling) as there is implicitly a catalog object there.

### 4. Global Visibility

Strong form of coupling &rarr; needs to be used in a controlled way.

Java doesn't strictly have global visibility, but it is achievable through
static attributes (but use Singleton). e.g.

```java
public class Global {
    public static int v = 1;
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    Global g = new Global();
    int n1 = g.v; // can access through object
    int n2 = Global.v; // can access through class
}
```

`v` will be the same regardless of it's access (through object or class) as it
is a static variable.

### UML Visibility Marks

![UML Visibility Marks](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/71_uml_vis.png){:class="image fit-small"}

* `+` &rarr; public
* `-` &rarr; private
* `#` &rarr; protected
* `/` &rarr; derived


# Mapping Designs to Code

Objective is to map design artefacts to code in an object oriented language.

OO implementation requires:

* Class and Interface definitions
* Method definitions

![`SalesLineItem` and `ProductDescription` example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/72_mapping_example1.png){:class="image fit-small"}

As `SalesLineItem` only has 1 `ProductDescription`, can make it an attribute.

```java
public class SalesLineItem {
    private int quantity;
    private ProductDescription description;

    public SalesLineItem(ProductDescription description, int qty) {...}

    public Money getSubTotal() {...}
}
```

Need to consider who will be making the SalesLineItem and hence where the
constructor lives. Also need to consider which attributes are to be included in
the constructor (there may be default values). Need to look at the *dynamic
models*.

![`Register` class in DCD](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/73_mapping_example2.png){:class="image fit-small"}

```java
public class Register {
    private ProductCatalog catalog;
    private Sale currentSale;

    public Register(ProductCatalog catalog) {...}

    public void endSale() {...}
    public void enterItem(ItemID id, int qty) {...}
    public void makeNewSale() {...}
    public void makePayment(Money cashTendered) {...}
}
```

![Creating `Register.enterItem(...)` method](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/74_mapping_example3.png){:class="image fit-small"}

```java
public void enterItem(ItemID id, int qty) {
    ProductDescription desc = catalog.getProductDescription(id);
    currentSale.makeLineItem(desc, qty);
}
```

### Multiplicity: Adding a Collection

![Adding a collection](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/75_mapping_example4.png){:class="image fit-small"}

```java
public class Sale {
    ...
    private List lineItems = new ArrayList();
    ...
}
```

Collections class is necessary to maintain visibility to all of the
`SalesLineItems`.

Choice of the collections class depends on the operations we want to perform on
the items:

* Key-based lookup &rarr; `Map`
* Growing ordered list &rarr; `List`

If implementing an interface, declare in terms of the interface:

```java
Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<String, Integer>();
```

`Map` is the interface, `HashMap` is the concrete instance (can change
initialisation without having to change variable type)

![Creating `Sale.makeLineItem(...)` method](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/76_mapping_example5.png){:class="image fit-small"}

```java
public void makeLineItem(ProductDescription desc, int qty) {
    lineItems.add(new SalesLineItem(desc, qty));
}
```

When implementing, move from **least-coupled** to **most-coupled**.

# State Machine Diagrams

*Note*: State machines relate to *compiler theory*.

A state machine describes the behaviour of an object in terms of:

* events that affect the object
* the state of the object between the events

![State machine for a telephone](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/77_telephone_sm.png){:class="image fit-small"}

* **Event** - a significant or noteworthy occurrence
* **State** - condition of the object at a moment in time
* **Transition** - directed relationship between two states such that an event
  can cause the object to change from the prior to the subsequent state

*State-dependent object* &rarr; reacts differently to events depending on their
state (interested in these for state machines)

**Applying State Machines**

Consider them when:

1. Object is *state-dependent* and has *complex behaviour*
2. Developing a communications or control application (very common, more so
   than business information systems)

Examples

* Complex Reactive Objects
    * Physical device controllers - *e.g. state of a lift*
    * Transactions and related business objects - *e.g. e-commerce
      transaction*
    * Role mutators (objects that change roles) - *e.g. employee from
      contractor to permanent*
* Protocols and Legal Sequences
    * Communications protocols
    * UI Page/Window Flow, Navigation
    * Use Case Operation Sequencing

![Web-page navigation example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/78_sm_webpage.png){:class="image fit-small"}

![Process Sale Operation Sequencing example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/79_sm_sale.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**State Machine Notation**

![State Machine Notation](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/80_sm_notation.png){:class="image fit-small"}

When** the object is in `State A`, if **trigger** event occurs, and **guard** is true, perform behaviour **action** and **transition** the object to `State B`

![Telephone example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/81_sm_telephone.png){:class="image fit-small"}

![Browser example](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/82_sm_browser.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Choice Pseudostate**

* Can have more than two choice states
* Can use `[else]` guard
* States don't have to be mutually exclusive (nondeterministic state machine)

![Choice PseudoState](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/83_sm_choice.png){:class="image fit-small"}

**Nested States**

* Transition into `Active` via `off hook`, which transitions into
  `PlayingDialTone` (or `Active.PlayingDialTone`)
* All substates of `Active` inherit the `on hook` transition

![Nested States](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/84_sm_nested.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Decision must be made as to what behaviour we want to model and at what level of
abstraction.

# Domain Model Refinement

Refine with:

* generalisations
* specialisations
* association classes
* time intervals
* composition
* packages

## Generalisation-Specialisation Class Hierarchy

![Payment Hierarchy - Conceptual](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/85_payment_conceptual.png){:class="image fit-small"}

![Payment Hierarchy - Class Diagram](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/86_payment_class.png){:class="image fit-small"}

  ![Payment Hierarchy - Class Diagram](
    {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/87_payment_abstract.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Being *{abstract}* indicates that the subclasses are **disjoint** and
**complete**. Every `Payment` can only be one of `Cash Payment`,
`Credit Payment`, or `Check Payment`.

Each *subclass* conforms to all of the properties of the *superclass.*

**Abstract v Concrete**

![Abstract vs Concrete Superclasses](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/88_abstract_concrete.png){:class="image fit-small"}

Generalisation:

* Identify commonality among concepts
* Define *superclass* (general concept)
* Define relationships with *subclasses* (specialised concepts)

Enables:

* Economy of expression
* Reduction in repeated information &rarr; less chance of errors
* Improved cohesion &rarr; domain model that matches intuition

These are all separate but related concepts.

![Specialisation Hierarchy](
  {{ site.aws }}/uni-notes/smd/89_spec_hier.png){:class="image fit-small"}

* The top associations are **power types**
* The bottom inheritance sets are **specialisation hierarchies**

Here we have two specialisation hierarchies for `coverage type` and
`insurance plan`.

Guideline for creating subclasses:

1. Subclass has additional attributes of interest
2. Subclass has additional associations of interest
3. Subclass is operated on, handled, reacted to, or manipulated differently to
   other classes in noteworthy ways

Modelling guidelines:

1. Declare superclasses abstract
2. Append the superclass name to the subclass
