[Playground Ideas](https://playgroundideas.org/) is a non-profit organisation
that supports anyone, anywhere to build a stimulating space for play using only
local materials, tools, and skills.

In a team of four, we were tasked with developing the requirements for a new
app for our client.

Along with all the requirements documentation, we built the following digital
prototype for our client.

### Interactive Prototype

Each client in the subject works with a few teams. The client chose our
prototype to be developed.

## Documentation

* Persona Profiles
* User Stories
* Goal Model
* Product Backlog
* Acceptance Tests

## Learning

**Don't overcook a prototype**

Using Axure for the prototype allowed us to do some pretty funky things.

But we started to built a bit too much logic in, which Axure just isn't quite
built for. The amount of time it took to do some of the interactions with
complex logic it would have been just as easy to just code it up...
