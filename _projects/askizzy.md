[AskIzzy](https://askizzy.org.au/) is a support service for people experiencing
difficulty in Australia, especially with homelessness.

## Team

I am part of a team of 11 Software Engineering students who are building some
extra functionality for the AskIzzy platform.

## Project

Our project is still in it's inception phase, but the AskIzzy platform is
widely used, with over 800,000 searches since it's launch.

It's exciting to be working on a project that is going to help people and make
a real difference. I'm looking forward to the challenge of working on software
that is going to be used so widely. Working in an engineering team of this
size is not something that I've experienced before, so that's also very
exciting.

## Tech

AskIzzy is a React application with a Node.js backend.

The architecture of our work will be decided once we have gathered more
requirements about the project.

I will keep this post up to date with progress!
