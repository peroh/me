[AskIzzy](https://askizzy.org.au/) is a support service for people experiencing
difficulty in Australia, especially with homelessness.

## Team

I was part of a team of 11 Software Engineering students. We built some extra
functionality for the AskIzzy platform.

## Project

The AskIzzy platform is widely used, with over 800,000 searches since it's
launch. It was exciting to work on a project that is going to help people and
make a real difference.

In Semester 1 I was the Product Manager, working closely with the client to
understand their needs, and ensure that the product we were building was fit
for purpose.

In Semester 2 I was the Scrum Master, leading the agile delivery of the product
and managing each sprint.

## Tech

AskIzzy is a React application with a Node.js backend.

This was a great opportunity to improve my javascript skills and to learn
React.
