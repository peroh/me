This is a project I am working on to help organisations manage their members,
especially their paper-based tasks.

At the moment, it is a Django application that allows you to manage a member
database and create awards, events, and courses. Members can sign up to
these courses and events.

The application fills out certain forms that are usually done manually. For
example, once a course has members signed up to it, the course admin can
simply click "Create Paperwork".

For example, if they were to choose "Assessment Checklist":

<span class="image fit">

</span>

The functional version of the app has had no work done on the UI yet. It would
be nice to eventually get it looking like the wireframes I did. Maybe in React
