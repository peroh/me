<p>Hi 😀</p>
<p>
  I am a Software Engineer and have recently completed my Masters at the
  University of Melbourne.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not studying &#x1F4D6;, you'll find me playing water polo &#x1F93D;,
  paddling my surf ski &#x1F6F6;, helping out at my lifesaving club &#x1F30A; or
  working on my own little projects &#x1F6E0;.
</p>
<p>
  Being so heavily involved in a volunteer organisation, I'm quite passionate
  about using or building technology to remove manual or paper-based processes.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my teen years, I played high-level water polo and represented
  Australia. I attribute my ability to work hard (and get up early) to water
  polo.
</p>
<p>
  I was into the sciences at school. I ended up doing a Commerce degree, and
  whilst this has helped my understanding of business, after a year in corporate
  finance I decided to make a change. I found software and computer science and
  haven't looked back &#x1F60E;
</p>

<h5>Favourite quotes</h5>
<blockquote>
  I think it is important to reason from first principles rather than by
  analogy. The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy... First
  principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world. You boil things
  down to the most fundamental truths and say, “What are we sure is true?” … and
  then reason up from there. - <strong>Elon Musk</strong>

<blockquote>
  There is no passion to be found in playing small - in settling for a life that
  is less than the one you are capable of living. -
  <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong>

<blockquote>
  While you're out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same
  time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning. Just
  remember that. - <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>
