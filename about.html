<p>Hi üòÄ</p>
<p>
  I am a Software Engineering student at the University of Melbourne,
  completing my final year of Masters.
</p>
<p>
  When I'm not studying &#x1F4D6;, you'll find me playing water polo &#x1F93D;,
  paddling my surf ski &#x1F6F6;, helping out at my lifesaving club &#x1F30A; or
  working on my own little projects &#x1F6E0;.
</p>
<p>
  Being so heavily involved in a volunteer organisation, I'm quite passionate
  about using or building technology to remove manual or paper-based processes.
</p>
<p>
  Throughout my teen years, I played high-level water polo and represented
  Australia. I attribute my ability to work hard (and get up early) to water
  polo.
</p>
<p>
  I was into the sciences at school. I ended up doing a Commerce degree, and
  whilst this has helped my understanding of business, after a year in
  corporate finance I decided to make a change. I found software and computer
  science and haven't looked back &#x1F60E;
</p>

<br><h5>Favourite quotes</h5>
<blockquote>
  I think it is important to reason from first principles rather than by analogy.
  The normal way we conduct our lives is we reason by analogy...
  First principles is kind of a physics way of looking at the world.
  You boil things down to the most fundamental truths and say,
  ‚ÄúWhat are we sure is true?‚Äù ‚Ä¶ and then reason up from there.
  - <strong>Elon Musk</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  There is no passion to be found in playing small - in settling for a life that
  is less than the one you are capable of living.
  - <strong>Nelson Mandela</strong>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
  While you're out there partying, horsing around, someone out there at the same
  time is working hard. Someone is getting smarter and someone is winning.
  Just remember that.
  - <strong>Arnold Schwarzenegger</strong>
